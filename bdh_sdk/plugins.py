"""Plugin contract for Black Diamond Hub apps.

Every app (built-in or installed from its own repo) describes itself with a
single ``PluginSpec``. The hub reads these specs to add the app to
INSTALLED_APPS, mount its URLs and put its tiles on the homepage.

This module is the public surface that plugin repos import, so it must stay
free of Django model/settings imports: specs are loaded while settings are
still being built.

    Django is set up. They are resolved on first use:

    - ``status``: ``() -> Status | None``. Called in a worker thread with a
      timeout; return None when there is nothing worth showing.
    - ``shortcuts``: ``() -> iterable of Shortcut``.
    - ``run_shortcut``: ``(shortcut_id) -> str | None``. Runs a shortcut the
      hub has already checked is offered in the caller's mode. Raise to
      report failure; the optional return value is shown to the user.
    - ``websocket_routes``: a list of Channels URL patterns (e.g.
      ``"myapp.routing.websocket_urlpatterns"``). Imported by the ASGI
      application after Django is set up and mounted under the shared
      websocket router.
    - ``stay``: ``() -> Stay | None``. Reports the stay in progress, if any;
      the homepage is in guest mode while one is reported. Called like
      ``status`` (worker thread, timeout, cached briefly).
